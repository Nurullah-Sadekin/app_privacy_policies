Before you start, make sure you have:

### For Personal Verification (KYC):
- 📱 Your smartphone with camera
- 🆔 National ID Card (NID) - both sides
- 🤳 A well-lit space for taking your selfie
- ⏰ 5-10 minutes of your time

### For Business Verification:

---

## Step 1: Personal Verification (KYC)

### What is KYC?

KYC stands for "Know Your Customer." It's a simple process where you verify your identity using your National ID Card and a selfie. This helps keep your account secure and unlocks better features.

**Why do we need this?**
- Protects your account from fraud
- Required by Bangladesh Bank regulations
- Unlocks higher transaction limits
- Gives you access to more features

---

### Understanding Your Verification Status

Your sManager app will show one of these statuses:

| Status | What it Means | What to Do |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| ⏳ **Not Started** | You haven't begun verification yet | Start the KYC process |
| ✅ **Verified** | Your identity is confirmed! | Move on to Business Verification |
| 🔄 **Processing** | We're reviewing your documents | Wait 1-2 business days |
| ❌ **Needs Attention** | Something needs to be fixed | Check the app for details and resubmit |
| 📸 **Selfie Pending** | We need a clearer selfie photo | Take a new selfie |
| 👁️ **Under Review** | Our team is checking manually | Wait for notification |

---

### How to Complete KYC

Follow these simple steps in your sManager app:

#### Step 1: Take a Photo of Your NID (Front Side)

📸 **Tips for a great photo:**
- Make sure all text is clear and readable
- No glare or shadows on the card
- Take the photo on a plain, dark background
- Keep your phone steady - no blurry images
- Make sure all four corners of the card are visible

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Photo is too dark or too bright
- ❌ Card is cut off at the edges
- ❌ Flash creates glare on the card
- ❌ Photo is taken at an angle

---

#### Step 2: Take a Photo of Your NID (Back Side)

📸 **Follow the same tips as Step 1:**
- Clear, well-lit photo
- No glare or reflections
- All text should be readable
- Plain background
- All corners visible

---

#### Step 3: Take a Selfie

🤳 **How to take a good selfie:**
- Face the camera directly
- Make sure your face is well-lit (natural light is best)
- Remove sunglasses or hat
- Keep a neutral expression
- Make sure your whole face is visible
- Don't use filters or effects

**Why we need this:**
Your selfie helps us confirm that you are the same person shown on your NID card.

---

#### Step 4: Fill in Your Information

You'll need to enter:
- **Full Name** (exactly as shown on your NID)
- **NID Number** (10 or 13 digits from your card)
- **Date of Birth** (as shown on your NID)
- **Gender** (Male/Female)

**Important:** Make sure all information matches your NID exactly. Any mismatch will cause rejection.

---

#### Step 5: Submit for Verification

After you submit:
1. You'll see a confirmation message
2. We'll send you a notification
3. Processing usually takes **1-2 business days**
4. You can check your status anytime in the app

---

### What Happens After Submission

**During Processing (1-2 business days):**
- Our system automatically checks your NID information
- We verify your selfie matches your NID photo
- We confirm your details with official records

**You'll receive a notification when:**
- ✅ Your verification is approved
- ❌ We need you to resubmit (with clear instructions on what to fix)

**Can I use sManager while waiting?**
Yes! You can continue using basic features while your verification is being processed.

---

### If Your KYC is Rejected

Don't worry! This is common and easy to fix. Here's why KYC might be rejected:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| 📸 Photos are blurry | Retake photos in better lighting, keep phone steady |
| 🌞 Too much glare on NID | Avoid using flash, take photo in natural light |
| 😊 Selfie doesn't match NID | Make sure you're not wearing glasses/hat, face camera directly |
| ℹ️ Information doesn't match | Double-check your NID number, name, and date of birth |
| 🔢 NID already used | This NID is linked to another account - contact support |

**How to resubmit:**
1. Open sManager app
2. Go to Profile or Verification section
3. Follow the prompts to submit new photos/information
4. Make sure to fix the issues mentioned in the rejection notice

---

- 🚀 Access to all sManager features
- 💰 Higher transaction limits (up to 10 lakh BDT daily)
- 👥 Add staff members to your account
- 🏪 Create your online store

---

### Understanding Your Business Status

| Status | What it Means | What to Do |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| ⏳ **Not Started** | You haven't provided business info yet | Complete KYC first, then start |
| 🔄 **Processing** | We're reviewing your business details | Wait 2-4 business days |
| ✅ **Verified** | You're a Premium Business Account! | Enjoy all features |
| ❌ **Rejected** | We need better information | Check details and resubmit |

---

### How to Complete Business Verification

#### Step 1: Choose Your Business Type

Select the option that best describes your business:

| Type | Best For | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| 🌐 **Online Business** | Digital/E-commerce businesses | Facebook shop, website store, online services |
| 🏪 **Offline Business** | Physical stores | Retail shop, restaurant, salon, grocery |
| 🔄 **Both** | Hybrid businesses | Shop with online delivery, restaurant with online orders |

---

#### Step 2: Provide Business Location

You'll need to select:
- **Division** (e.g., Dhaka, Chittagong)
- **District** (e.g., Dhaka, Gazipur)
- **Thana** (e.g., Gulshan, Banani)
- **Full Address** (your business location)

**Can I use my home address?**
Yes! If you run your business from home, that's perfectly fine.

---

#### Step 3: Upload Business Photos/Videos

**For Physical Stores (Offline/Both):**

📸 **Shop Photo Requirements:**
- Clear photo showing your business storefront or workspace
- Make sure your business name/signboard is visible (if you have one)
- Good lighting - natural daylight is best
- Should clearly show it's a real business location

🎥 **Shop Video (Optional but Recommended):**
- Short video (10-60 seconds) of your business
- Walk around and show the main areas
- This helps us verify faster!

**For Online Businesses:**
- If you have social media business pages (Facebook, Instagram), note down the links
- You can provide your website URL if you have one

---

#### Step 4: Provide Nominee Information

A nominee is a trusted person you choose to be associated with your account.

**Who can be your nominee?**
- Family member (father, mother, spouse, sibling, child)
- Close friend
- Business partner

**Information you'll need:**
- Nominee's full name
- Relationship to you (father, mother, brother, sister, spouse, etc.)
- Nominee's date of birth

**Why we need a nominee:**
This is an additional security measure required by regulations.

---

#### Step 5: Upload SIM Ownership Proof

This proves that the mobile number you're using actually belongs to you.

**How to get your SIM ownership screenshot:**

1. **Dial this code from your registered number:**
   - For most operators: `*16001#`
   - Follow the on-screen prompts

2. **You'll see a screen showing:**
   - Your name
   - Your NID number
   - SIM registration details

3. **Take a screenshot** (must be clear and readable)

4. **Upload the screenshot in the app**

**Important:** The name and NID should match your KYC information.

---

#### Step 6: Upload Trade License (Optional)

**Do I need a Trade License?**
No, it's optional! But having one helps:
- ✅ Faster approval process
- ✅ Shows your business is registered
- ✅ May help with higher limits

**If you have a Trade License:**
- Take a clear photo of the license
- Make sure all text is readable
- License should be valid (not expired)
- Upload it in the app

**If you don't have a Trade License:**
- You can still complete verification
- It might take a bit longer to process
- You can always add it later

---

#### Step 7: Review and Submit

Before submitting, double-check:
- ✅ All photos are clear and readable
- ✅ Business information is accurate
- ✅ Nominee details are correct
- ✅ Address matches your actual business location
- ✅ SIM ownership screenshot is clear

Then hit **Submit**!

---

### What Happens After Submission

- We verify your photos and documents
- We may contact you if we need clarification

**You'll receive a notification when:**
- ✅ Your business is verified - congratulations!
